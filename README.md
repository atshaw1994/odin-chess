# Odin Chess

A command-line chess game built with Ruby as a project for The Odin Project. This project aims to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles and a solid understanding of Ruby syntax by creating a playable, two-player chess game.

### Features

* **Standard Rules:** All standard chess rules are implemented, including pawn promotion, castling, and en passant.
